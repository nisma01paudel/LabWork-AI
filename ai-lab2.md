### 5. Blocks World Problem
#### WAP in Python to Calculate the Heuristic Value of States

#### Global heuristic: `e(p)`
- For each block that has the correct support structure, give `+1` to every block in the support structure.
- For each block that has the wrong support structure, give `-1` to every block in the support structure.
